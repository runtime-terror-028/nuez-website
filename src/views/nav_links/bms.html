                    <p id="hero_p">There's a fast way to reduce energy expenses, optimize building equipment performance, and enhance occupants' comfort, all while complying with national directives. A Building Management System, or BMS system, gives you full control of your building. By installing or retrofitting a building management system, you can quickly and easily take control of your building and achieve a wide range of benefits in one cost-effective solution.</p>

                    <h3 id="hero_h3">A Building Management System (BMS) is a comprehensive computer system designed to aid with building management. Once installed, the BMS communicates with all of the equipment and systems currently installed in the building.</h3>
                    <p id="hero_p">With integrated building management systems, owners can monitor and manage core systems, such as air conditioning, heating, ventilation, lighting, or energy supply systems. Dealing with multiple energy sources, such as electricity, gas, and rooftop solar panels. A good BMS system integrates each system individually, giving owners complete control over each supply.

                        The term building automation system (BAS) is also sometimes referred to as BMS, highlighting the fact that a BMS rarely requires active input once set up correctly and is largely automated. However, an integrated building management system is more often used to refer to BMS systems applied on a larger scale, e.g. to condominiums, tertiary buildings, and public buildings, as part of a full-fledged automation and controlled computer-based system.

                        <h2 id="hero_h2">How does it work?</h2>
                        <h3 id="hero_h3">A BMS system operates by gathering data from buildings sensors and equipment, processing it centrally, and issuing commands to regulate building systems based on predefined criteria and user inputs, utilizing interconnected hardware and software components.</h3>
                        <p id="hero_p">With a BMS, a building manager or owner can do more than simply monitor performance. Operators can optimize individual systems, such as monitoring and control functions for air conditioning or other systems to use energy more efficiently and to reduce costs. Owners gain a global vision of their building's performance and turn them into smart buildings, all whilst reducing their administrative tasks and increasing energy savings.
